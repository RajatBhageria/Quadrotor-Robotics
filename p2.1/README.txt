We all worked on the project together without looking at each others code, 
and helped each other understand the PDF on homographies. 

The main PDF I used to solve this project is: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi07/cse252a/homography_estimation/homography_estimation.pdf

I also used the lecture on Projective Transformations 

Initially I was using the Procrastes method but that of course didn't work 
since I didn't have depth data

I also used the RotToQuat file from the project 1.1.
