function [path, num_expanded] = dijkstra(map, start, goal, astar)
% DIJKSTRA Find the shortest path from start to goal.
%   PATH = DIJKSTRA(map, start, goal) returns an M-by-3 matrix, where each row
%   consists of the (x, y, z) coordinates of a point on the path.  The first
%   row is start and the last row is goal.  If no path is found, PATH is a
%   0-by-3 matrix.  Consecutive points in PATH should not be farther apart than
%   neighboring cells in the map (e.g.., if 5 consecutive points in PATH are
%   co-linear, don't simplify PATH by removing the 3 intermediate points).
%
%   PATH = DIJKSTRA(map, start, goal, astar) finds the path using euclidean
%   distance to goal as a heuristic if astar is true.
%
%   [PATH, NUM_EXPANDED] = DIJKSTRA(...) returns the path as well as
%   the number of points that were visited while performing the search.
